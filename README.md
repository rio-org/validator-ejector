# Lido Validator Ejector

Daemon service which loads LidoOracle events for validator exits and sends out exit messages when necessary.

On start, it will load events from a configurable amount of blocks behind and then poll for new events.

## Requirements

- Folder of pre-signed exit messages as individual JSON files in either [spec format](https://github.com/lidofinance/validator-ejector/blob/d2e4db190935239e019618b948a1bd1cea20f88f/src/services/messages-processor/service.ts#L19-L25) (generic) or [ethdo output format](https://github.com/wealdtech/ethdo/blob/master/docs/usage.md#exit)
- Execution node
- Consensus node

This service has to be run in a single instance as it expects to fulfil every request to exit. Each unfulfilled request (no exit message being present for required validator) will log an error.

## Configuration

### Operation Modes

For both modes, Ejector will monitor exit request events, but react to them differently.

#### Messages Mode

In this mode, Ejector will load pre-signed exit messages from .json files on start, validate them, and submit them to a CL node when necessary.

Mode is activated by setting the MESSAGES_LOCATION variable.

#### Webhook Mode

In this mode, Ejector will make a request to a specified endpoint when an exit needs to be made instead of submitting a pre-signed exit message to a CL node.

Mode is activated by setting the VALIDATOR_EXIT_WEBHOOK variable.

This allows NOs to implement JIT approach by offloading exiting logic to an external service and using the Ejector as a secure exit events reader.

On the endpoint, JSON will be POSTed with the following structure:

```json
{
  "validatorIndex": "123",
  "validatorPubkey": "0x123"
}
```

200 response from the endpoint will be counted as a successful exit, non-200 as a fail.

### Environment Variables

Options are configured via environment variables.

Messages can also be loaded from remote storages: AWS S3 and Google Cloud Storage.

Simply set a url with an appropriate protocol in `MESSAGES_LOCATION`:

- `s3://` for S3
- `gs://` for GCS

Authentication setup: [GCS](https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication/application-default-credentials#attached-sa), [S3](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-javascript/v3/developer-guide/setting-credentials-node.html).

## Preparing Exit Messages

Once you generate and sign exit messages, you can encrypt them for storage safety.

Exit messages are encrypted and decrypted following the [EIP-2335](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-2335.md) spec.

You can check a simple example in JS in `encryptor` folder:

Simply copy JSON exit message files to `encryptor/input`, set encryption password as `MESSAGES_PASSWORD` in `.env` and run:

```bash
yarn encrypt
```

Done, your encrypted files will be in `encryptor/output`.

## Running

Either:

- Use a Docker image from [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/lidofinance/validator-ejector)
- Clone repo, install dependencies, build and start the service:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/lidofinance/validator-ejector.git
cd validator-ejector
yarn
yarn build
yarn start
```

Don't forget env variables in the last command.

## Metrics

Enable metrics endpoint by setting `HTTP_PORT=1234` and `RUN_METRICS=true` environment variables.

Metrics will be available on `$HOST:$HTTP_PORT/metrics`.

Available metrics:

- exit_messages: ['valid'] - Exit messages and their validity: JSON parseability, structure and signature
- exit_actions: ['result'] - Statuses of initiated validator exits
- event_security_verification: ['result'] - Statuses of exit event security verifications
- polling_last_blocks_duration_seconds: ['eventsNumber'] - Duration of pooling last blocks in microseconds
- execution_request_duration_seconds: ['result', 'status', 'domain'] - Execution node request duration in microseconds
- consensus_request_duration_seconds: ['result', 'status', 'domain'] - Consensus node request duration in microseconds
- job_duration_seconds: ['name', 'interval', 'result'] - Duration of Ejector cycle cron job
- job_message_reloader_duration_seconds: ['name', 'interval', 'result'] - Duration of Pre-signed message reloader cron job
- exit_messages_left_number - Number of exit messages left
- exit_messages_left_percent - Percentage of exit messages left

## Safety Features

- Encrypted messages allow for secure file storage
- Invalid files in messages folder are noticed
- Exit JSON structure is checked
- Exit signature is fully validated
- Exit event pubkeys are checked to exist in transaction data
- Exit event report data hashes are checked to match hashes in original submitReport() Oracle transactions
- Exit events original consensus transactions are checked to be signed by allowlisted Oracles
- Node requests are repeated on error or timeouts
- Amount of messages left to send out can be checked using metrics
- Dry run mode to test setup
